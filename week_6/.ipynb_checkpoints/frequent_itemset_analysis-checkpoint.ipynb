    "```\n",
    "Technological advances have drastically improved the ability for companies to collect, store, and track data on consumer behavior. As a consequence, many brands and big businesses are using massive data sets for data mining or market basket analysis. With these practices, companies are able to identify purchase patterns and relationships, such as commonly co-occurring purchases (e.g. “75% of consumers who purchase bread also purchase milk”). Knowing associated purchases subsequently allows marketers to better target consumers through direct messages or displaying certain items together. In fact, marketers already are acting upon this data, at some point we’ve all come across the “Shoppers who bought this item also bought…” while browsing products online.\n",
